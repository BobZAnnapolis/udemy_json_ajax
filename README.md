- for the php files - get to a command line and say : php -S localhost:8000
- then bring up a browser, navigate to that uri and specify full path to the file

  - a.overrideMimeType("application/json");

json, ajax examples

JavaScript is the most in demand programming language on the web today.

Learning how to implement AJAX and use data like JSON formatted data can accelerate the amazing things that JavaScript can do within your web code.

JSON -  JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard technology that is used to transmit data in a human readable format.   JSON is language independent.  It provides a powerful way to move data back and forth.  Learning to use JSON data in JavaScript can open the door to really powerful data handling within your applications.

AJAX - asynchronous JavaScript and XML allows you to send and receive data from other files without page refreshing.  You can display data and information in response to the User interactions within your webpages.  Dynamic content loading without page refreshes.

This course is designed to help you learn how to use these two amazing technologies together.   Source files and all the code used within the course is included.  Step by Step instruction with examples of how to use JSON formatted data.  Turn JSON data into JavaScript objects and use them as needed within your code.  Load data the easy way.  AJAX allows you to take this data import one step further and load data on the fly within your JavaScript.   Course will demonstrate how to do this and a whole lot more.   As a bonus the course also covers how to send data to the server.

JSON and AJAX are in demand skills and knowing how to use them will increase what you can do within your web pages.

JSON resources
JSON (canonically pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/ jay-sən; sometimes JavaScript Object Notation) is an open-standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is the most common data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication (AJAJ), largely replacing XML which is used by AJAX.

JSON is a language-independent data format. It derives from JavaScript, but as of 2016, code to generate and parse JSON-format data is available in many programming languages. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json.
Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format; two competing standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404, define it. The ECMA standard describes only the allowed syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations.
A typical mashup fetches JSON-format data from several different web servers using an Open API.

AJAX resources
Ajax (also AJAX; /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to createasynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.

Ajax is not a technology, but a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display – and allow the user to interact with – the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.
